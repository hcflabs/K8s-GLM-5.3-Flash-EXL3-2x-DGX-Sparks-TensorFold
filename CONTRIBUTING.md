# Contributing

Thanks for taking a look. This repository is a Kubernetes/k3s port of the
upstream TensorFold recipe; `README.md` covers what it deploys and `RELEASING.md`
covers how chart versions are cut.

By participating you agree to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and
contributions are accepted under the repository's [MIT license](LICENSE)
(inbound = outbound).

## Scope

In scope: the Helm chart, the Ansible playbooks, the scripts under `scripts/`,
CI, and documentation.

Out of scope — please raise these upstream instead:

| Topic | Where |
| --- | --- |
| the recipe, patches and the serving image itself | [MiaAI-Lab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-2x-DGX-Sparks-TensorFold](https://github.com/MiaAI-Lab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-2x-DGX-Sparks-TensorFold) |
| model weights and model behaviour | the relevant Hugging Face model card |
| the k3s collection used to join nodes | [k3s-io/k3s-ansible](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible) |

## Commit messages

Commits drive the release: `cliff.toml` derives the next chart version and the
changelog from them, so please use conventional commits.

| Prefix | Chart version effect |
| --- | --- |
| `feat:` | minor |
| `fix:`, `perf:`, `refactor:`, `style:`, `build:`, `revert:` | patch |
| `docs:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `test:` | none |

A chart change committed as `docs:` or `chore:` publishes nothing, so use
`feat:`/`fix:` for changes to the chart itself. See `RELEASING.md`.

## Local checks

Run what CI runs before opening a pull request:

```bash
# chart renders and lints; it must also refuse to render without site values
helm lint chart -f chart/ci/test-values.yaml
helm template ci chart -f chart/ci/test-values.yaml > /dev/null

# shell
shellcheck -S warning chart/files/serve.sh chart/files/wait-for-worker.sh scripts/*.sh

# embedded script syntax
scripts/check-anchors.sh

# workflows
actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml

# ansible
cd ansible && ansible-playbook -i inventory.example.yml playbooks/site.yml --syntax-check
```

## Please do not commit

- API keys, k3s join tokens, vault passwords, or `.vault_pass`;
- your cluster's addresses, hostnames, node names, or interface/device names
  (fabric addressing and weights paths must stay required-without-default);
- your checkpoint paths or a model id you did not intend to publish.

The `chart/ci/test-values.yaml` placeholders and the documentation-range
addresses in `ansible/inventory.example.yml` exist so that examples never carry
a real deployment's details — keep it that way.

## Pull requests

CI must be green (the `chart` job). Releases are cut by maintainers from the
`release` workflow after merge; there is nothing to do in a pull request to
trigger one.
